_**null hypothesis: The average trip length for males is shorter than the average trip length for females.**_
_**alternative hypothesis: The average trip length for males is longer than the average trip length for females.**_

_comments:_

* suggestion to modify to the null hypothesis to: the avergae trip length for males is longer or the same for the average trip length for females
* the alternative hypothesis: the average trip length for male is shorter than the average trip length for females. 

# 2. Data

_comments:_

* the data primiarly interested is the average trip length for female and male groups. Most of the data wrangling focused on separating the dataset into two dataframes. 
* the data is well prepared and histogram and bar graph gives good visualization of the dataset. 


# 3. Z-test 

_**null hypothesis: The average trip length for males is shorter than the average trip length for females.**_

A z-score test is appropriate to compare the means for the two dataset.
