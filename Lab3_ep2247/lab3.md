##  Lab3

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

# 1)Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
testable hypothesis: what % of fat lost was significantly higher for the diet canidates then those who excercised
null hypothesis(H0): what % of fat lost was the same or lower for the diet canidates in comparison to those who excercied
H0 = Pt <= Pc 
Ha: average % of fat lost on excercise is larger or the same then those who dieted
H1: Pt > Pc


Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

# 2)Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
testable: the average IQ for children aged 1,2,3,and 4 is signifcantly lower for those whose mother smoked while pregnant compared to mothers who did not smoke
null: the average IQ for children aged 1,2,3,4 are equal for those whose mother smoked while pregnant compared to mothers who did not smoke

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

# 3) Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes

null: there is no correlation between diabetes and distribution of food deserts
Ha: there is a higher incidence of diabetes in proximity of food deserts

Contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
